# open-data-standard

## project overview

**Goal**: At some point in the future, the ODS4SC is the main accepted way to share supply chain data between platforms. Governments put out RFPs requiring the use in the systems they are buying, large ERP systems have standard plugins utilizing the standard, the open data platforms can exchange data easily between them. It is easy to obtain data along the supply chain when you need it. How did we get there?
